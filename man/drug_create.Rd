  prob_of_lpf = c(1, 0.97, 0.8, 0.55),
  barcode_res_pos = c(0, 1),
  prophylactic_pos = 1,
  dur_P = 25,

\arguments{
\item{prob_of_lpf}{Vector of probabilities for the chance of late 
parasitological failure (lpf). The vector gives the prob of lpf for 
each relevent barcode combination for a given drug. E.g. The default is:

\code{c(1.0, 0.97, 0.80, 0.55)} 

The vector is length 4, and so 2 barcode positions change the 
prob of lpf. If the parasite is 0,0 then the prob of lpf is 0 (1-1), 
but if it was 0,1 it would be 0.2.}

\item{barcode_res_pos}{Vector for which barcode positions correspond to which
drug resistance mechanism. E.g. the default is:

\code{c(0,1)}

Resistance to drug is encoded at barcode position 0 and 1}

\item{prophylactic_pos}{Vector for which barcode positions determine the
impact of drug resistance in shortening the effective prophylactic period.
E.g. the default is \code{c(1)}, which shows that for the drug,
the prophylactic position is encoded in barcode position 1.}

\item{dur_P}{Duration of prophylaxis in days. Default = 25.}

\item{dur_SPC}{Duration of slow parasite clearance. Default = 5.}

\item{drug_clearance_max_time}{Maximum number of days to which to consider 
waning prophylaxis. Default = 60 days.}

\item{prophylactic_probability}{Vector of changing probability of reinfection
due to waning prophylaxis. The last element reflects the probability after
\code{drug_clearance_max_time} and the first element is the probability at 
time = 0 days.}

\item{prophylactic_resistant_probability}{Vector of changing probability of 
 reinfection due to waning prophylaxis when challenged by a parasite that is
resistant to the partner drug. The last element reflects the probability after
 \code{drug_clearance_max_time} and the first element is the probability at 
 time = 0 days.}
