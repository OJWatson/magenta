## magenta 1.3.5

* Seasonality patch so that admin and country name specification to `pipeline`
correctly creates seasonal simulations.

## magenta 1.3.4

* Non-malarial fevers were not going through correct drug allocation so could not
track who was getting what drug when it was an NMF.

## magenta 1.3.3

* Prophylaxis fixes. Individuals who failed treatment and recrudesce were not getting
full duration of prophylaxis previously (short by a couple days) 

## magenta 1.3.2

* NMF fixes. Individuals not infected who are treated due to NMF go straight to 
an elongated prophylaxis. 

## magenta 1.3.1

* Importations can have same barcode as PLAF via `island_imports_plaf_linked_flag`

## magenta 1.3.0

* Major changes inplace for simulating resistance

## magenta 1.2.0

* Documentation for base model
* `dde::dopri` fix that caused deterministic model to fail below very small EIR

## magenta 1.1.0

* New `param_list_simulation_finalizer_create` used within `pipeline` to return Rcpp memory

## magenta 1.0.0

* New major version for stable base model for publication. Versioning now incremental. 
* New version fixes minor changes to historic strain clearing in resistance

## magenta < 1.0.0

* Iterative testing with versioning only used for distinguishing testing on cluster
